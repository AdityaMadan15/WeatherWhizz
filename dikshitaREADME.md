<h2> Objective </h2>
<p>This project was developed to build practical experience in front-end development. By creating a simple webpage using HTML and CSS, I learned how to clearly separate content structure from visual design. It also helped me grasp essential concepts such as semantic markup, external styling, and the basics of responsive design â€” forming a solid foundation for more advanced web development projects.
