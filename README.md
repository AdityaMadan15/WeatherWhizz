Project Description:
As part of my coursework, I have developed a simple web project consisting of two core files:

home.html – This file serves as the main structure of the web page. It contains the HTML (HyperText Markup Language) that defines the content and layout of the homepage. It includes elements such as the header, navigation menu, content section, footer, and links to styles and possibly other resources.

style.css – This file is used for styling the HTML page. It contains CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) rules that define the visual appearance of elements in the home.html file. These styles may include layout control, font styles, colors, margins, paddings, hover effects, and responsiveness for various screen sizes.

Key Features Implemented:
Basic structure using semantic HTML tags (<header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>, etc.).

External CSS linked via <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">.

Styling for visual clarity, including background colors, font choices, and layout.

Responsive design techniques (if included) using media queries in CSS.

Clean and readable code with proper indentation and comments for maintainability.

Objective:
The goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience in front-end web development by creating a basic webpage using HTML and CSS. It helped me understand the separation of structure and style and improved my understanding of how to build and design web interfaces.
